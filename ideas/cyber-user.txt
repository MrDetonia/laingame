Development plan
================

1. Find/write methods to use IRC server:
    1.0 Enter channel on server with specified name
    1.1 Method to send message to specified server and channel, for example: send_message(server, room, msg)
    1.2 Method to receive all messages, continually checking if there is any new message (probably in a loop)
    1.3 Method to get all users in a specified room and filter everyone with specified prefix, returning a list
    1.4 Method to parse messages to commands (what data serialization could be used?)
2. Creating interacting bot instances: 
    2.0 Bot A sends some dummy message when Bot B sends message with name + command 
    2.1 Draft commands, like "request stats", "announce stats", "announce action", etc
    2.2 Bot A sends serialized dummy data for Bot B request
3. UI planning stage
